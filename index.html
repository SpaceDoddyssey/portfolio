                <b>Wanderpath</b> puzzles are a brand new form of line puzzle I designed. <br>
                Solving a Wanderpath puzzle requires drawing a line from one endpoint to another,<br>
                while crossing back over the line when necessary in order to cross certain edges the required number of times.<br>
                After formalizing the rules of the puzzle, I created a puzzle generator in the Phaser javascript engine, and
                <a href="https://spacedoddyssey.github.io/Wanderpath/"> an HTML page to host it.</a>

                <br><br>
                <b>Bitwise Battle</b> is a wholly original board game I designed and prototyped. <br>
                Bitwise Battle pits 2-3 players against each other as they manipulate a string of digital binary using real 'bitwise operations'. <br>
                Reviews include "Even as an artist, I can get into this!" and "Makes me WANT to do my homework!"

                I teamed up with a few other members of the UC Santa Cruz Independent Gamedev Coalition to produce 
                <a href="https://anthony-molle.itch.io/youre-fired"><b></n>You're Fired!</b></a> for GMTK Game Jam 2023. <br>
                I helped implement the dynamic camera, particle effects, menus, and the initial controls, as well as miscellaneous bug fixing.
                You're Fired! came in the top 13% of 6,986 submissions in the Enjoyment, Creativity, and Overall rankings.

                I was the lead programmer for
                <a href="https://anthony-molle.itch.io/gimme-a-hand"><b>Gimme A Hand!</b></a> 
                as part of a team of 3 for Foundations of Video Game Design. <br>
                We used the free edition of the Construct game engine, which is very limited, and I'm very proud of what we managed to produce despite the limitations.
